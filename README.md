- Identify the basic concept and benefits of ICS.

### What is the Incident Command System?
The Incident Command System (ICS) is a standardized approach to incident management that:

- Is used for all kinds of incidents by all types of organizations and at all levels of government; ICS is applicable to small incidents as well as large and complex ones.
- Can be used not only for emergencies, but also for planned events.
- Enables a coordinated response among various jurisdictions and agencies.
- Establishes common processes for incident-level planning and resource management.
- Allows for the integration of resources (such as facilities, equipment, personnel) within a common organizational structure.

### When is ICS Used?
The Incident Command System (ICS) can be used to manage any type of incident, including a planned event (e.g., the Olympics, the Governor's inauguration, state fairs, a local parade, etc.). The use of ICS is applicable to all types of incidents, regardless of their size or cause.

As a system, ICS is extremely useful. Not only does it provide an organizational structure for incident management, but it also guides the process for planning, building, and adapting that structure.

Using ICS for every incident or planned event provides the practice that will help to maintain and improve skills needed to effectively coordinate larger or more complex efforts.
