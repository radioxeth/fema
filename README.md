## Lesson 2 Overview
This lesson presents the National Incident Management System (NIMS) management characteristics. These characteristics are the foundation of all NIMS command and coordination components, including the Incident Command System (ICS).

Objective:

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the 14 NIMS management characteristics.

### Making ICS Work
Effective incident management relies on a common organizational structure for managing resources, making decisions, and assigning tasks. The Incident Command System (ICS) uses a standardized management approach to ensure that incidents are properly managed and communications are effectively coordinated during an incident.

As an incident occurs, you may be called upon to assist -- making you a part of this organizational structure. To ensure success, you should understand how this structure works.

### NIMS Management Characteristics: Overview
The Incident Command System (ICS) is based on the following 14 proven NIMS management characteristics, each of which contributes to the strength and efficiency of the overall system:

- Common Terminology
- Modular Organization
- Management by Objectives
- Incident Action Planning
- Manageable Span of Control
- Incident Facilities and Locations
- Comprehensive Resource Management
- Integrated Communications
- Establishment and Transfer of Command
- Unified Command
- Chain of Command and Unity of Command
- Accountability
- Dispatch/Deployment
- Information and Intelligence Management

### Common Terminology
The Incident Command System (ICS) establishes Common Terminology that allows diverse incident management and support organizations to work together across a wide variety of emergency functions and hazard scenarios. This common terminology covers the following:

- **Organizational Functions**: Major functions and functional units with incident management responsibilities are named and defined. They remain standard and consistent.
- **Resource Descriptions**: Major resources – including personnel, equipment, teams, and facilities – are given common names and are “typed” with respect to their capabilities.
- **Incident Facilities**: Common terminology is used to designate the facilities in the vicinity of the incident area.
During an incident:

- Communications should use common terms.
- Organizations should avoid radio codes, agency-specific codes, acronyms, or jargon. Usage of these types of codes may cause confusion or possibly compromise life safety due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation.

The goal is to promote understanding among all parties involved in managing an incident.

### Modular Organization
The Incident Command System (ICS) organizational structure develops in a modular fashion based on the incident’s size and complexity.

- The responsibility for the establishment and expansion of the ICS modular organization rests with the Incident Commander.
- As the incident grows more complex, the ICS organization may expand as functional responsibilities are delegated.

### Management by Objectives
The Incident Commander or Unified Command (which will be discussed later), establishes incident objectives that drive incident operations.

Management by Objectives includes the following:

- Establishing specific, measurable incident objectives.
- Identifying strategies, tactics, tasks and activities to achieve the objectives.
- Developing and issuing assignments, plans, procedures, and protocols to accomplish identified tasks.
- Documenting results for the incident objectives.

### Incident Action Planning
Incident action planning guides effective incident management activities.  An Incident Action Plan (IAP) is a concise, coherent means of capturing and communicating overall incident priorities, objectives, strategies, tactics, and assignments in the context of both operational and support activities. The IAP should focus on addressing the needs of future timeframes (called operational periods).

To be effective, an IAP should:

- Cover a specified timeframe
- Be proactive
- Specify the incident objectives
- State the activities to be completed
- Assign responsibilities
- Identify needed resources
- Specify communication protocols

For smaller/less complex incidents, the IAP may be oral or written, except for hazardous materials incidents, which require a written IAP. FEMA has developed a series of ICS Forms for use in developing a written IAP.

### Manageable Span of Control
Depending on your role within the Incident Command System (ICS) structure, you may be asked to manage the activities of others.

**Span of control** refers to the number of individuals or resources that one supervisor can manage effectively during an incident. The optimal span of control is one supervisor to five subordinates (1:5).  However, effective incident management may require ratios significantly different from this. This ratio is a guideline--incident personnel should use their best judgement to determine the appropriate ratio for an incident.

If too much responsibility is given to the supervisor, the span of control may become unmanageable. A manageable span of control on incidents may actually vary depending upon the type of incident, nature of the task, hazards and safety factors, and distances between personnel and resources.

Maintaining a manageable span of control is particularly important at incidents where safety and accountability are a top priority.

### Incident Facilities and Locations
Depending upon the incident size and complexity, various types of support facilities may be established by Incident Command. These designated facilities typically include:

- Incident Command Post (ICP) 
- Incident base, staging areas, and camps 
- Mass casualty triage areas 
- Point-of-distribution 
- Emergency shelters

### Resource Management
Comprehensive Resource Management describes standard mechanisms to identify requirements, order and acquire, mobilize, track and report, demobilize, and reimburse and restock resources such as personnel, teams, facilities, equipment and supplies.

Key resource management activities include:

- Resource Identification and Typing 
- Qualification, Certification and Credentialing Personnel 
- Planning for Resources
- Acquiring, Storing and Inventorying Resources

### Integrated Communications
Incident communications are facilitated through the development and use of a common communications plan and interoperable communication processes and systems that include voice and data links.

Integrated Communications are necessary to:

- Maintain connectivity
- Achieve situational awareness
- Facilitate information sharing

### Establishment and Transfer of Command
The command function should be clearly established at the beginning of an incident. The jurisdiction or organization with primary responsibility for the incident designates the Incident Commander and the process for transferring command.

Transfer of command may occur during the course of an incident.  When command is transferred, the process should include a briefing that captures all essential information for continuing safe and effective operations.

### Unified Command
In a Unified Command there is no single "Commander." Instead the Unified Command manages the incident through jointly approved objectives. Unified Command allows agencies with different legal, geographic, and functional responsibilities to work together effectively without affecting individual agency authority, responsibility, or accountability.

Unified Command is typically established when no single jurisdiction, agency or organization has the authority and/or resources to manage the incident on its own. This can include incidents involving multiple jurisdictions, a single jurisdiction with multiagency involvement, or multiple jurisdictions with multiagency involvement.

### Chain of Command
Chain of command is an orderly line that details how authority flows through the hierarchy of the incident management organization. Chain of command:

- Allows an Incident Commander to direct and control the actions of all personnel on the incident. 
- Avoids confusion by requiring that orders flow from supervisors.

Chain of command does NOT prevent personnel from directly communicating with each other to ask for or share information. While formal direction and control follows the chain of command, informal information sharing occurs throughout the ICS structure.

### Unity of Command
While chain of command relates to the overall hierarchy of the organization, unity of command deals with the fact that all individuals have a single designated supervisor they report to.

Based on the principle of unity of command, you will:

- Report to only one Incident Command System (ICS) supervisor.
- Receive work assignments only from your ICS supervisor.

When you are assigned to an incident, you no longer report directly to your day-to-day supervisor. In fact, there is no correlation between the ICS organization and the administrative structure of any single agency or jurisdiction. This is deliberate, because confusion over different position titles and organizational structures has been a significant stumbling block to effective incident management in the past.

While chain of command and unity of command are applied in all incidents, the actual command structure itself and the responsibilities of those involved change based on the type of incident and your specific role.
