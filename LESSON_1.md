## Lesson 1: ICS Overview
Lesson 1 provides an overview of the Incident Command System (ICS). At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the Whole Community approach to ICS.
- Identify the basic concept and benefits of ICS.

### What is the Incident Command System?
The Incident Command System (ICS) is a standardized approach to incident management that:

- Is used for all kinds of incidents by all types of organizations and at all levels of government; ICS is applicable to small incidents as well as large and complex ones.
- Can be used not only for emergencies, but also for planned events.
- Enables a coordinated response among various jurisdictions and agencies.
- Establishes common processes for incident-level planning and resource management.
- Allows for the integration of resources (such as facilities, equipment, personnel) within a common organizational structure.

### When is ICS Used?
The Incident Command System (ICS) can be used to manage any type of incident, including a planned event (e.g., the Olympics, the Governor's inauguration, state fairs, a local parade, etc.). The use of ICS is applicable to all types of incidents, regardless of their size or cause.

As a system, ICS is extremely useful. Not only does it provide an organizational structure for incident management, but it also guides the process for planning, building, and adapting that structure.

Using ICS for every incident or planned event provides the practice that will help to maintain and improve skills needed to effectively coordinate larger or more complex efforts.

### ICS as a Component of the National Incident Management System (NIMS)
The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a systematic, proactive approach to guide all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to work together to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the effects of incidents. NIMS provides a consistent foundation for all incidents, ranging from daily occurrences to incidents requiring a coordinated Federal response.

NIMS is organized into three major components:

- Resource Management
- Command and Coordination - including the Incident Command System
- Communications and Information Management

It is important to note that the Incident Command System (ICS) is just one part of NIMS.

### Benefits of ICS
The Incident Command System (ICS) has positively impacted incident management efforts by:

- Clarifying chain of command and supervision responsibilities to improve accountability.
- Leveraging interoperable communications systems and plain language to improve communications.
- Providing an orderly, systematic planning process.
- Implementing a common, flexible, predesigned management structure.
- Fostering cooperation between diverse disciplines and agencies.

### ICS: Built on Best Practices
The Incident Command System (ICS) has been tested for more than 40 years of emergency and nonemergency applications by all levels of government; and in nongovernmental and private–sector organizations.

ICS helps to ensure:

- The safety of responders, community members, and others.
- The achievement of incident objectives.
- The efficient use of resources.

### Lesson 1 Summary
You have completed the Course Welcome and Incident Command System (ICS) Overview lesson. This lesson presented the following key points:

- ICS is a standardized management tool that allows better coordination and use of resources.
- ICS represents organizational “best practices” and has become the standard for emergency management.
- ICS can be used to manage the response for all incidents and planned events.

ICS works! It saves lives!
